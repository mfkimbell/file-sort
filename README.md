# Python_FileSort

The purpose of this project was to practice manipulating files on my computer with `Glob`.

Sorts files into folders based on their file types or names. I only did 3 examples, but with glob you could select for any number of complex named files into any folder.

Here is the entirety of the code:

Example of the folder before:

Now I run the code after I have cd'd into the designated folder.
The first folder gets all .txt files with only a capital letter as the name.
The second folder gets all files with "py_" at the beginning.
The third folder will get all files with a .py extension at the end.

And here is what the inside of the folers look like:
